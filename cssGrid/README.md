## Steps

1. In html and css only, recreate the above design.
2. Deploy it, probably using something like [netlify](https://netlify.app/).
3. [Complete this simple form for a coach to review it](https://airtable.com/shrPYZwx2GoE4h3Um).

## Requirements

* All your styling is in a separate file to the html.
